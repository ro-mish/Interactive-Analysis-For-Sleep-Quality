# Info

## Description:
Implementing a chatbot for the user to interface with is a useful CRM and general business strategy. It creates a personalized alternative to FAQ, reduces the need for trivial calls to call centers, and typically performs many client-related procedures autonomously. This is one of the motivations for creating this project. 

It is built using a TensorFlow Deep Learning model that associates user input with Generic responses. Currently, the base functionality of the chatbot is present. The model for sleeping is under development and will be released in the next commit.
