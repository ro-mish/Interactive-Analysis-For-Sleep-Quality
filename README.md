# GameTime Chatbot

## Description:
Implementing a chatbot for the user to interface with is a useful CRM and general business strategy. It creates a personalized alternative to FAQ, reduces the need for trivial calls to call centers, and typically performs many client-related procedures autonomously. This is one of the motivations for creating this project. 

It is built using a TensorFlow model that associates user input with Generic responses.
